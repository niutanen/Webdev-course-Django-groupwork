''' Feedback from Ahmed Beder:
The information about views is good. In addition to that, you might consider following:

Other views as Payment callback, User profile could be useful.
You might want to add “Highest scores” view also.
If you describe your views being accessible both logged in and not.
This is quite useful if you go for the Social media sharing goal, as it allows you to add metadata about the game on the template which is accessible to the crawlers that read the page you share. ogp, open graph tags
