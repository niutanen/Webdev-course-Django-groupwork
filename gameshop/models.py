Feedback from Ahmed Beder:
The usage of Django’s default User model is a good choice.
For the game field, it is almost never the case where you’d need a field that is an array.
Instead, I would recommend using a  model that has a field that references the Game, a field that references the User(Player).
You could use a many to many relationship with the games as well.

'''Feedback from Ahmed Beder:
Payment MODEL
The ‘state’ field would be useful.
It will be helpful to identify if the payment was cancelled, received or still in process.
I would recommend to add a unique secure payment_id field for security reasons.
This could be used to identify the payment and prevent fraud.
For the state of payment consider using enums.

Make sure you test this properly.
Most projects have security holes that reduce points.
Make sure that you can't reuse payments, pay for something else you selected etc.
All-in-all try to break your own product!
